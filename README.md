# Time-Series Data EDA

A hands-on tutorial for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on time-series datasets using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

This notebook explores key techniques and steps essential for understanding and analyzing time-series data, including:

- Loading and preparing time-series datasets  
- Computing moving statistics (rolling and expanding)  
- Visualizing trends, seasonality, and volatility  
- Handling date-time indexing and resampling  
- Identifying peaks, troughs, and anomalies in the data

## Tools

Python 3.x
Packages:
pandas
matplotlib
y_finance or panda_datareader

## Purpose

Learning core EDA methods for time-series analysis

Building intuition through visualization and stepwise exploration

Adapting the notebook for new datasets (financial, sensor data, etc.)
